# Spam Detection (NLP) — Text Classification with Machine Learning

This project implements a **Spam Detection** system using classic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a **machine learning classifier** to predict whether a message is **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**.

The full workflow is implemented inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Project Overview

Spam detection is a binary text classification task widely used in real-world applications such as:

- Email filtering
- SMS spam detection
- Customer support message routing
- Content moderation pipelines

In this notebook, we build a complete ML pipeline from raw text → cleaned features → trained model → evaluation.
