# NLP Projects 🧠📚

This repository contains a collection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects implemented in **Python**, focused on building strong fundamentals in **text preprocessing, feature extraction, and text classification** using both **machine learning** and **deep learning** approaches.

Each project is organized in its own folder with a dedicated notebook and README.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1) Spam Detection (Machine Learning)
📂 `01_Spam_Classification/`

A classic **Spam vs Ham** text classification pipeline using:
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction (vectorization)
- **Logistic Regression** classifier (scikit-learn)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix)

### 2) RNN Text Classification (Deep Learning)
📂 `02_RNN_Classification/`

A deep learning notebook for text classification using:
- Tokenization and vocabulary building
- Encoding text into sequences + padding
- Training a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model using **PyTorch**
- Evaluation on validation/test sets
