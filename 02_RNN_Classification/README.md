# RNN Text Classification (PyTorch)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for **text classification** using **PyTorch**.  
The notebook demonstrates a complete deep learning workflow including preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

Text classification is a core Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where a model predicts a label from an input sentence/document (e.g., sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic classification).

In this notebook, we train an **RNN-based classifier** to learn sequential patterns from text and produce a final classification output.
